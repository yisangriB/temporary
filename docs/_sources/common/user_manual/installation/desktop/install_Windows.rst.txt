Install on Windows 10
=====================

.. only:: R2D_app

   Install Java
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

   .. note::
      Java is needed to use OpenSHA to characterize the regional seismic hazard (see :ref:`ground_motion_tool`). If you do not plan to use that feature, you can skip this step of the installation.

   If you have not yet installed Java, please download the latest installer from `java.com <https://java.com/en/download/>`_ , run it, and follow the on-screen instructions to install Java.

   .. note::
      The Java website should automatically detect your operating system and offer the corresponding installer for you to download. Make sure you see "64-bit Java for Windows" at the top of the page before downloading the installer.

Download the Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To download the |app|, navigate to the |appLink| page which should resemble |figDownload|. The download page contains a list of downloadable files and directories.

      quoFEM download page.

Click on the file with a name ending with **Windows_Download.zip** to download the |app|. In the pop-up window, click on the **Download** button in the bottom right corner. After the download completed, extract the zip archive to a location in your filesystem.

We suggest placing the directory in the **C:\\SimCenter** folder. Once here, you can create a shortcut to the application and move this shortcut to your Desktop.


Test the Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the installation procedure has been completed, it is a good practice to run some basic checks. Navigate to the location where you placed the application and open it by running the |short tool id|.exe executable. You should see the user interface shown in |figWinUI|. The installation can be tested by running the example problem |test example|.

.. note::

   Since the SimCenter is not recognized as a Windows vendor, our applications are not recognized by the operating system as being signed. Consequently, you may receive a warning message when you start the |short tool name| application for the first time.

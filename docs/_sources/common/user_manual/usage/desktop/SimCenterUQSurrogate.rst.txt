Surrogate Modeling
*********************

.. Note:: 
     Surrogate modeling functionality of quoFEM is built upon `GPy <https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/>`_ library (available under BSD 3-clause license), an opensource python framework for Gaussian process modeling developed in the Sheffield machine learning group. 

The ``Train GP Surrogate Model`` module is used to construct a Gaussian process (GP) based **surrogate model** that substitutes expensive computational **simulation models** or physical experiments. Consider a simulation model, with input random variables (or parameters) :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` and output quantity of interests :math:`\boldsymbol{y}`, denoted as :math:`\boldsymbol{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x})`. A surrogate model for the corresponding simulation model can be built by different user-provided information types:

   :header-rows: 1

   * -  
     - RV (model input :math:`\boldsymbol{x}`)
     - QoI (model response :math:`\boldsymbol{y}`)
   * - **Case1**
     - bounds of random variables :math:`\boldsymbol{x}`
     - simulation model: :math:`\boldsymbol{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x})` 
   * - **Case2**

     - simulation model: :math:`\boldsymbol{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x})`

     - dataset: :math:`\{\boldsymbol{x^{(1)},x^{(2)}, ... ,x^{(N)}}\}`
     - dataset: :math:`\{\boldsymbol{y^{(1)},y^{(2)}, ... ,y^{(N)}}\}`


**Case 1 (Sampling and Simulation)**: User provides lower and upper bounds of each random variable (RV) and a simulation model. quoFEM will find the best training points sequentially by the adaptive **design of experiments** strategies until the model converges or reaches a user-specified computational tolerance. 

**Case 2 (Import RV Dataset and run Simulation)**: User provides sample population of RVs as a separate text file. quoFEM will run simulations to get QoI values and build a surrogate model. 

**Case 3 (Import both RV and QoI Dataset)**:  User provides sample population of RVs and QoIs. quoFEM will not run any simulations and build a surrogate model purely based on the provided dataset.

**The trained surrogate model can be saved in a file (.pkl format) along with a meta-information (.json format) and later imported in quoFEM** in place of the original simulation model for UQ analysis or optimization purposes. See 2.2.5 for how to import the surrogate model in quoFEM.

Input description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Case 1: Sampling and Simulation
--------------------------------
When the **Training Dataset** option is set to the ``Sampling and Simulation``, a simulation model should be presented in the **FEM tab**. The training points are sampled adaptively by the design of experiments.

.. _figSim1:

.. figure:: figures/Surrogate1_SimUQ.jpg

   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 800

   Input panel for surrogate modeling

* **Random Seed**: Seed of the random number generator
* **Target Accuracy (Normalized Error)**: The target accuracy is defined in terms of normalized root-mean squared error (NRMSE) estimated by leave-out-one cross-validation (LOOCV).

	.. math::
		:label: NRMSE

		\begin{align*}
			\rm{NRMSE} ~ &= \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{k=1} (y_k-\hat{y}_k)^2}}{\max_{k=1,...,N}(y_k)-\min_{k=1,...,N}(y_k)}
		\end{align*}	

   |   where 
   |      :math:`y_k` : exact response from the model simulation
   |      :math:`\hat{y}_k`: estimated response by LOOCV surrogate model prediction
   |      :math:`N`: number of samples used to train the surrogate model

* **Maximum Number of Model Runs**: When the number of simulation runs reaches the limit, the analysis will be terminated.
* **Maximum Computation Time (in minutes)**: When the tolerance limit of the computation time is reached, the analysis will be terminated. There will be a few minutes of error.

User can also activate the **Advanced Options for Gaussian Process Model**

   Sampling and Simulation - Case 1

* **Kernel function**: Correlation function for Gaussian process regression. Matern5/2 function is the default, and Matern3/2, Radial Basis, and Exponential functions are additionally supported.
* **Linear trend function**: When increasing or decreasing trend is expected over the variables domain, a linear trend function may be introduced. The default is unchecked, ie. no trend function.
* **Responses are always positive**: When the user can guarantee that the response quantities are always greater than 0, user may want to introduce a surrogate model in log-transformed space. The default is unchecked, ie. original physical coordinate.
* **Number of Initial Samples (Design of Experiments)**: User may set the number of the initial design of experiments (DoE) manually, while the default is 4 times the number of random variables.

.. Tip:: 

   If the user wants to inactivate the adaptive DoE feature, one can set **Number of Initial Samples** equal to the **Maximum Number of Model Runs**. In this case, all the training samples will be generated at once by Latin hypercube sampling. The computation may be faster, but caution should be taken since the resulting verification measures are more likely to overestimate the level of accuracy and underestimate the error size.

Additionally, users may populate the initial samples directly from data files by activating **Start with Existing Dataset**

The following two data files are requested:

* **Train Points (Input)**
* **System Responses (Output)**

where

* Each text file is a numeric table with the columns separated by a tab, space, or comma. Multiple headers can be presented following the symbol %. 
* The number of rows corresponds to the number of training data samples.
* Train Points (Input): The number of columns should match the number of RVs presented in the **RV tab** and also match with required inputs of the simulation model provided in the **FEM tab**. **The order of the columns should match the random variables presented in the RV tab** (See :numref:`figSim4` and :numref:`figSim7` for example.)
* System Responses (Output): The number of columns  and the order of columns should match the QoI quantities presented in **QoI tab**.
* Both files need to be provided, and the number of columns for the two files should be the same.
* See :numref:`figSim4` for example input data sheets.

   Example of data input files

.. Note:: 

   * When the **Start with Existing Dataset** is checked, one redundant simulation will be performed in order to check the consistency between the data and the simulation model. An error will be thrown when the dataset cannot be reproduced by the simulation model.
   * If the user wants to use the samples purely from data files and does not wish to introduce any simulation model, refer to Case 3 below.


Case 2: Import RV Dataset and run Simulation
----------------------------------------------
When the **Training Dataset** option is set to ``Import Data File`` AND **Get results from datafile** check box is unchecked, quoFEM will run simulations to get result (QoI)  values for imported RV locations and build a surrogate model.

.. _figSim5:

.. figure:: figures/Surrogate5_SimUQ.jpg
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 800

   Import Data File - Case 2

The following data file is requested

* **Train Points (Input)** 

where

* The text file is a numeric table with columns separated by a tab, space, or comma. Multiple headers can be presented following the symbol %. 
* The number of rows corresponds to the number of training data samples.
* The number of columns should match the number of RVs presented in the FEM model in the **FEM tab**. The order of columns should match those presented in the **RV tab**.
* See :numref:`figSim4` (left) for an example data file.


Case 3: Import both RV and QoI Dataset
------------------------------------------------------------------
When the **Training Dataset** option is set to ``Import Data File`` AND **Get results from datafile** check box is unchecked, quoFEM will not run any simulations and build a surrogate model purely based on the user-provided dataset.

.. _figSim6:

.. figure:: figures/Surrogate6_SimUQ.jpg
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center
   :width: 800

   Import Data File - Case 3

The following two data files are requested:

* **Train Points (Input)**
* **System Responses (Output)**

where

* Each text file is a numeric table with columns separated by a tab, space, or comma. Multiple headers can be presented following the symbol %. 
* The number of columns corresponds to the number of training data samples.
* The number of rows of each file respectively corresponds to the number of RVs and QoIs.
* Both files need to be presented, and the number of columns should correspond to each other.
* See :numref:`figSim4` for example data files.

**FEM tab** will be inactivated in Case 3 as model information is not required.

.. Tip::
	- Surrogate model can be continued after when they are terminated by saving and importing RV and QoI samples.

RV (Random Variables) Tab
--------------------------
**Case 1 and 2**: The bounds of RVs need to cover the domain of interest in future applications, while it should not be unnecessarily stretched. **Input type** and **Distribution** should be set to **Parameters** and **Uniform**. When dataset is provided, make sure to match the order of RVs in the **RV tab** to the order of data columns. Any correlation values will be ignored.

   Example of RV tab

**Case 3**: **RV data tab** will be populated automatically as soon as the dataset is imported.

Goodness-of-Fit
-----------------
Once the training is completed, the following three verification measures are presented based on leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) error estimation.

* **Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)**

  | LOOCV prediction :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_k` at each sample location :math:`\boldsymbol{x}_k` is obatined by the following procedure: A temporary surrogate model :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=f^{sur}_{loo,k}(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{x}})` is constructed using the samples :math:`\{\boldsymbol{x}_1,\boldsymbol{x}_2,...,\boldsymbol{x}_{k-1},\boldsymbol{x}_{k+1},...,\boldsymbol{x}_N\}` and the calibrated parameters, and the prediction :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_k=f^{sur}_{loo,k}(\boldsymbol{x}_k)` is compared with the exact outcome :math:`y_k=f(\boldsymbol{x}_k)`.

* **R2 error**

  | R2 error is defined in terms of the total sum of squares over the residual sum of squares

	.. math::
		:label: R2

		\begin{align*}
			R^2 &= 1 - \frac{\sum^N_{k=1} (\hat{y}_k-\mu_\hat{y})^2}{\sum^N_{k=1} (\hat{y}_k-y_k)^2}
		\end{align*}	

  | The surrogate model is considered well-trained when the **R2 (<1) approaches 1**
 

* **Normalized root-mean-squared-error (NRMSE)**

	.. math::
		:label: NRMSE

		\begin{align*}
			\rm{NRMSE} ~ &= \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N_t} \sum^{N_t}_{k=1} (y_k-\hat{y}_k)^2}}{\max_{k=1,...,N_t}(y_k)-\min_{k=1,...,N_t}(y_k)}
		\end{align*}	

  | The surrogate model is considered well-trained when the **NRMSE (>0) approaches 0**

* **Correlation coefficient**

  | Correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures linear correlation between two variables

  .. math::
    :label: corr

      \rho_{y,\hat{y}} = \frac{\sum^N_{k=1}(y_k-\mu_{y})(\hat{y}_k-\mu_{\hat{y}})} {\sigma_y \sigma_\hat{y}}


  |   where 
  |      :math:`\mu_{y}` : mean of :math:`\{y_k\}`
  |      :math:`\mu_{\hat{y}}`: mean of :math:`\{\hat{y}_k\}`
  |      :math:`\sigma_{y}`: standard deviation of :math:`\{y_k\}`
  |      :math:`\sigma_{\hat{y}}`: standard deviation of :math:`\{\hat{y}_k\}`

  | The surrogate model is considered well-trained when the **correlation coefficient (** :math:`-1<\rho<1` **) approaches 1**


* Additionally **scatter plot** between the predicted and exact responses are presented: Well-trained model will form a clear diagonal line while poorly trained model are more scattered around.

   :width: 800

   Well-trained surrogate (left) and poorly trained surrogate (right) models

.. Note:: 
     Since these validation measures are calculated from the cross-validation predictions, they can be **biased**, particularly when highly localized nonlinear range exists in actual response surface and those regions are not covered by the training samples. The introduction of adaptive DoE helps to suppress the bias by enabling the targeted selection of simulation points around potentially faulty regions.


.. Warning:: 
     Note that GP-based surrogate models are essentially developed to fit smooth, continuous functions. When the surrogate model is poorly trained, a parametric study is highly recommended to check any possible discontinuity presented in the simulation model.


Saving Options
--------------
* **Save GP Model**: The constructed surrogate model is saved. Two files and a folder will be saved, which are the **SurroateGP Info File** (default name: ``SimGpModel.json``), **SurroateGP model file** (default name: ``SimGpModel.pkl``), and **Simulation template directory** that contains the simulation model information (``templatedir_SIM``). **IMPORTANT**: User may NOT change the name of the template directory ``templatedir_SIM``.
* **Save GP Info**: This is a report file generated for user reference. It contains the GP model parameter and other information. The default file name is ``GPresults.out``.
* **RV Data**, **QoI Data**:It saves the samples of RV and QoI. The default file names are ``X.txt`` and ``Y.txt``, respectively. **IMPORTANT**: To continue surrogate modeling with additional simulations, save the RV and QoI sample files using this button and import them as initial points. Refer to the 'Start with Existing Dataset' option in Case 1.
